## 📊 Betting Strategy Examples

### Conservative:
- Bet $10 on one color
- Slow and steady
- Lower risk

### Aggressive:
- Bet $50 on multiple colors
- Higher potential wins
- Higher risk

### Diversified:
```
Red:    $10
Blue:   $10
Yellow: $10
White:  $10
Green:  $10
Pink:   $10
Total:  $60
```
- Covers all colors
- Guaranteed match
- But still loses money over time (house edge!)

## 🔬 Simulation Insights

### What You'll Discover:

1. **The Fair Game Has House Edge**
   - Even with equal probabilities
   - Expected loss: ~7.87%
   - Math always favors the house

2. **Tweaked Game is Worse**
   - House edge increases to ~11-13%
   - Win rate drops significantly
   - Lose $33.64 more per 100 games

3. **No Strategy Beats Math**
   - Random betting: loses
   - Single color: loses

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Betting Rules:
- ✅ **Can bet 0** (skip that color)
- ✅ **Can bet positive numbers** ($1 - $bankroll)
- ❌ **Cannot bet negative numbers** (validation prevents this)
- ❌ **Cannot bet more than bankroll** (validation prevents this)

### Game Mechanics:
- All three dice rolled simultaneously
- Each die is independent
- Colors chosen uniformly (fair game) or weighted (tweaked)
- Payouts calculated for each color separately

### Statistical Reality:
- Fair game: **7.87% house edge** 
- Tweaked game: **~11-13% house edge**
- Your expected value: **negative**
- Long-term outcome: **always lose**
