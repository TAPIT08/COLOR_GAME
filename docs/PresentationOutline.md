# Video Presentation Outline (Option 2)

## Slide 1 — Title
- Filipino Color Game: Modeling & Simulation (Option 2)
- Team / Course / Date

## Slide 2 — Motivation & Goals
- Why the Color Game? Simple, probabilistic, demonstrable.
- Goal: Compare fair vs. tweaked models; quantify house edge.

## Slide 3 — Rules & Models
- Fair game: 6 colors, 3 dice, uniform probabilities.
- Payouts: 0/1/2/3 matches → −B/+B/+2B/+3B.
- Tweaked: house color weight (e.g., 20%), payout modifier (e.g., 95%).

## Slide 4 — Expected Value & House Edge
- Fair EV per $1 ≈ −$0.0787 ⇒ ~7.87% house edge.
- Tweaked raises edge to ~11–13% (typical settings).

## Slide 5 — App Demo (Game Mode)
- Show placing bets and dice roll visuals.
- Emphasize mechanics and instantaneous outcomes.

## Slide 6 — App Demo (Simulation Mode)
- Choose preset (10K) and parameters.
- Run simulation; highlight reproducibility via seed.

## Slide 7 — EDA: Profit Distributions
- Histograms & boxplots: tweaked shifts left.
- Interpret dispersion and central tendency.

## Slide 8 — EDA: House Profit & Win Rates
- Bar chart: average house profit (tweaked > fair).
- Pie charts: wins vs. losses.

## Slide 9 — Quantitative Comparison
- Mean player loss per play (fair vs. tweaked).
- House edge increase in percentage points.

## Slide 10 — Conclusions
- Small tweaks guarantee long-run house profit.
- Lessons: EV, probability weighting, payout design.
- Next steps: strategy variants, sensitivity analysis.

## Closing
- Call to action: Explore the repo and run your own simulations.
